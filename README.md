# Session_25_Recursion_Part_1
In this comprehensive Python lecture, we embark on an enlightening journey into the world of recursion, covering the complete theory and practical application.We explored the mathematical foundation of recursion, the Principle of Mathematical Induction (PMI), and its powerful role in solving recursive problems.

üîµ **Recursion Unveiled**: Understand the core concepts of recursion, its significance, and its elegant beauty in problem-solving.

üìê **Principle of Mathematical Induction**: Dive deep into the mathematics behind recursion. Learn how to use PMI as a powerful tool to analyze and solve recursive problems systematically.

üßÆ **Recursive Factorial**: Witness the magic of recursion as we demonstrate how to use this powerful technique to solve the factorial problem with elegance and efficiency.
